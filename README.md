Welcome! 

This repository hosts both course materials and the working files for EDCI338 at the University of Victoria, Spring 2022. It is a work-in-progress between January and April 2022 with contributors from an undergraduate course in education technology called *Social Media and Personalized Learning*. Members of the general public and especially the #EdTech community are welcome to follow along and contribute via issues or pull-requests.
