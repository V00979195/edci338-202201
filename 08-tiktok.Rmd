## Demographics {-} 

### Target Audience and Users {-}

 Tik Tok is available in over 150 countries, storing the information of over 1 billion users. The widespread population of users has approximately 120 million users residing in the United States, 87 million from Indonesia and 72 million in Brazil. Surprisingly, Canada does not currently make the shortlist of countries (top 10), that hold the greatest number of users. Owed to the increase of technological advancement, it is evident why the main demographic of consumers is what is commonly referred to as the “Gen Z”. A totalled 60% of users match Gen Z’s age group (individuals born between the years of 1997-2012) with a majority aged between 10-25. With that being said, it should be noted that TikTok requires its users to meet the minimum age requirement of 13 years old. 
 An older demographic of seniors can be seen on this app too, though they constitute an unusual subset. Similar success has been recorded of older generations, with great traction and activity on their platforms. To name a few, @oldgays is a group of older men that share their thoughts and opinions on life, and @cookingwithLynja shares insight on how to make yummy meals in a quick and easy fashion. 
 In comparing the gender of TikTok’s users, there is an obvious breakdown of genders and their active use on the app. To date, identified females make up the majority of users with a remainder of male users (39%) and others (2%) constituting the rest. TikTok targets individuals with interests and hobbies of all sorts. Promising a guarantee for users to be matched with creators that align with their hobbies and interests, running from fashion to baking, dance and/ or travel. 
 Tiktok has enabled users to create business accounts to allow for easy, accessible and reviewal of the accounts analytics. Businesses in particular have greatly utilized the analytics page to pinpoint the age, gender, and likes of their active users. The information received from the analytics, successfully supplies and equips companies with the proper tools to adapt and  progress. 

#### Non-users {-}

TikTok does not require users to create an account to browse the platform. There are a variety of methods that allow non-users to navigte the platform. With a few simple steps, users that do not wish make an account are able to view the content. 
The first option consists of following three simple steps:
1. Go to TikTok.com
2. Select “For you” on the left sidebar 
3. Begin watching videos without logging into an account

Videos made and created on TikTok’s platform can also be viewed on other neighbouring media platforms. Multiple channels on youtube have dedicated their content to uploading what is currently trending on Tik Tok. Content creators of youtube make it possible for users without an account to gain quick and easy access to like and comment on the video on youtube. 
TikTok videos may also be viewed without an account if they’re sent by message, Snapchat, email, Facebook etc. 
With that being said, there are a variety of features that can not be accessed by users without an account. Without an account, you are unable to follow creators, like videos, see or write comments on the videos, upload or share content or join creators ‘lives’.

#### How Users are Connected {-}

TikTok features allow users to generate communities online. Users can stay connected through the act of sharing, following, commenting or liking other creators’ posts. Simply by locating and following a creator’s account, their videos will be readily available for viewing in the “following” section of TikTok. Unless the creator’s content is made private, a user does not need to wait for access to be granted, in order to proceed in viewing the video of the account. Furthermore, there are obligations for users to follow one another back, however, access to the creator’s videos is still made available regardless of mutual following. 
 There exists two types of pages to view content. The ‘for you page’ showcases viral Tik Toks and creators of all sorts. This side of TikTok may allow users to discover new creators they wish to connect with or follow. After the user has followed the creator, their content may now exist on the other side of TikTok. 
 Separated into two sections, the videos published by the users following will appear on the ‘following’ page, while other creators will appear on the “for you page”. The users following page exists to serve individuals with accessible access to their favourite content creators and avoid missing out on their friend’s and families’ posts.
 Another way to interact on TikTok is to engage in creators’ “lives”. Users may choose to go live to interact with their followers in real-time. By sharing insight into their daily living, creators find great success in expanding their followers and creating user engagement. Another unique feature allows for creators to go live with other fellow creators on the app. TikTok lives provide users with access to comment, ask questions and send or receive gifts. Although, TikTok requires users to meet a following of 1,000 and be 16 years of age in order to host a live. 


### Content {-}

#### Content Sharing {-}

On TikTok, users have the ability to share any post they see on their feed. In order to share a video, users must tap the arrow located in the bottom right hand corner. Once the user has clicked the share arrow, a variety of methods to share are displayed. These options include the ability to share the video through copying the link or sharing it on another social media platform such as Snapchat, Messages, Facebook messenger or Instagram.

#### Privately Sharing Content {-}

When a user initially creates a TikTok account, the videos and comments are set to be public. This means any TikTok user can access the content and follow the account. However, TikTok does have Privacy settings that allow the account to be changed to private. When the account is set to private, the account holder can approve or deny follow requests and only their approved followers can view the content. 

Even if the account is set to public, the account holder has access to edit the privacy settings on individual videos. These privacy settings allow users to allow everyone access, only the followers that users follow back, or only the account holder to view the video.

#### Viral Content {-} 

Content published on TikTok has the ability to go viral any time a user creates and uploads a public video onto their account. If the content a user creates gets picked up by the TikTok algorithm, it will be shared to other users via the “For You” page. Based on the user's interests and past interactions with TikTok videos, TikTok's algorithm curates a "For You" page of video content from creators the user may not follow. The algorithm utilizes users’ data on interactions with videos such as the screen time of watching a video, liking the video, and/or sharing it.

Once the video makes it to the “For You” page, it has the opportunity to go viral. As a video receives more comments, likes, shares, and duets, the greater its chances are of being picked up by the algorithm. The completion rate of a users’ videos is an additional factor that influences ranking. In short, the more a video is liked and fully watched, the greater it’s chances are of going viral.

### TikToks ToS and Privacy Policy {-} 

[Terms of Service](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service?lang=en)
[Privacy Policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy-row?lang=en)
[Privacy Policy for Younger Users](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy-for-younger-users?lang=en)

### Key Takeaway's from TikToks Privacy Policy {-}

 The Terms of Service (ToS) and Privacy Policy (PP) serve as a legally binding contract between TikTok and its users. Confined within this document is advanced terminology which the average person would find difficult to comprehend. A crucial point stated in the document notes that Tiktok is not held accountable for the privacy policy of third-party partnerships and advertisements that are provided in the app via Cookies (TikTok. June 2, 2021. Para 20). Following that, Tiktok is also not liable if the user is to click a link outside or from a Third-party source (TikTok. June 2, 2021. Para 37). 

 Under the section 'User Content and Behavioural Information' TikTok explains that by giving informed consent, the app may collect users information present in their content including their background, face, location and bodily attributes. They also disclose information may be obtained regarding your interests, gender, and age as means to “personalize” content and "[promote] your content to other users and exploring whether your profile presents further opportunities for collaboration" (TikTok. June 2, 2021. Para 10).

 With reference to the Privacy Policy for Younger Users (YUPP), the document was substantially shorter that that of the General Privacy Policy (GPP). The Policy states that limited information is obtained from youth under the age of 13 residing in the United States (US).  This includes the username, password, date of birth, device ID, IP address, web browser type and some app activity (TikTok. January 2020. Para. 1-2 ). This information is only acquired for troubleshooting and other analytical services. In addtion, this is also collected for legal and governmental reasons which not only is rare, but is reasonable as it is law enforcement. (TikTok. January 2020. Para. 4 & 6). An apparent difference found between the YUPP and GPP resides in the difference of protection between users. Those who are 13 and under are subject to much less severe policies and are inclinded to more privacy. In contrast, those who are over the age of 14 are forced to forgo their privacy and grant TikTok access to a great deal of their personal information. 

 Users should be encouraged to review the Policy Acts laid out by TikTok, in order to be fully made aware of and comfortable with their decision to sacrifice their privacy rights. TikTok recommends that any questions or concerns with respect to the ToS or PP be directly addressed to them via email (TikTok. June 2, 2021. Para 34).

### Concerns with TikTok {-}

As with any social media platform, educators should be aware of the inappropriate content that can be accessed on the app. The most obvious sources of adult content on TikTok are profanity and suggestive clothing. Although the minimum age for a TikTok user is 13 years old, the app does not use any age verification tools when users are creating an account. With the ability to search any hashtag or keywords in the app, users can access any content created by another user. Although TikTok has strict guidelines on nudity and graphic content, since any user can upload their opinions on any topic, offensive content may be shared on the app. Due to the nature of the social media app, when a video becomes viral millions of people can be impacted by ampliganda. According to DiRestas, ampliganda is the new word for misinformation in the digital age. On TikTok, any user can now shape perceptions and realities by having their ideology amplified through shares, likes, and comments of a mass audience.
