## Demographics
### Target audience (age, demographics, political leaning, interests, hobbies, etc.)  
Age: In the U.S., 63% of adults (12+) use Facebook and users aged 18+ spend an average of 34 minutes per day on the social media platform. An important note about Facebook’s advertising audience is that there is a good focus on almost all the age groups. Primarily, however, 32% of Facebook’s advertising audience are people aged 25-34.  
Demographics: Amazingly, nearly a third of world’s population uses Facebook at least once a month. Although other social media platforms like TikTok have had a rising popularity over last several years, Facebook is still managing to get engagement from many users around the world. In addition, in terms of gender statistics, 56% of Facebook users are male with 44% being female. Interestingly, nearly 82% of college graduates are on Facebook and are much more likely to use the platform compared to high school graduates. Lastly, as of January 2022, India has the greatest number of users on Facebook (329.65 million), followed by the U.S. (179.65 million).
Political Leaning: Facebook certainly tracks political views of its users and assigns political labels. However, it’s important to note that 73% of people believe that their assigned political label is accurate whereas 27% believe that their political label is inaccurate and doesn’t correctly reflect their political views. In spite of all this, 35% of Facebook users are assigned as liberals, 35% are assigned as conservatives, and the rest (29%) are assigned as moderate.    
Interests:  
“To say that everyone is its target market is not an understatement.” People sign up and use Facebook for a variety of reasons and there are many ways for them to express their interests. Users’ feeds are customized based on the people they follow and things they like such as movies TV shows, artists, books, sports teams, athletes, celebrities, restaurants, apps, and games.  
Hobbies:  
Facebook allows its users to add their hobbies to their profiles so they can find others with similar interest. There are many hobbies that could be added, and they are always shown to public users. One of the main features on the platform is Facebook Groups. It connects people from all around the world based on hobbies or interests, which is proven to be an effective way to build engaging communities.  
### Can non-users browse or search content?  
Yes, non-users can use search engines such as Google to search for Facebook profiles, pages, posts, and other content. All they have to do is include the keyword “Facebook” in their web search or more efficiently include “site:facebook.com” to search for content on Facebook only.   
### How are users connected (e.g., on some platforms, you request a connection which needs to be accepted, but on others, you can follow anyone without them reciprocating)  
On Facebook, it’s possible to message anyone without having to send a friend request, but the normal way for people to connect is by sending a friend request. Users can follow pages of celebrities, artists, athletes, etc. without them having to follow back.   
### Can content be shared privately?  
Yes, there are multiple methods of sharing content privately with someone else on Facebook. The simplest way is by messaging them directly via Messenger and attaching files. Another method for private sharing is by creating a post on one’s personal feed and customizing the audience for the post so that only specific friend(s) can view the post. Sharing content posted by other users can also be done privately by sending them in Messenger and sharing to the personal feed privately.    
### How is content shared?  
The main method for sharing content is by directly creating a post, which can be customized to be shown to different audiences. Users can photos, videos, and gifs along with other additional content when creating a post. It’s also possible host Q&As, stream live video, tag other people, which provide engagement and dynamic options for users to interact. Moreover, there is an option for people to create private photo or text stories that will be visible for 24 hours on Facebook and Messenger. If users want to share content that other people have created, they can simply go to the post and tap the share button. They can choose one of the following options:  
•	Share Now (Friends)  
•	Share to Feed  
•	Share to Your Story (Friends)  
•	Send in Messenger  
•	Share on a friend’s profile  
### How does content go viral?  
One of the many ways to go viral is to post something that 	is related to the news, trending topics, or other major events that are happening in the real world. There will be many users who are searching and viewing posts about trending topics so there is a higher chance for a post to go viral if it’s socially relevant. In addition, most viral content is short and original. Users have a very short attention span and are often quickly scrolling through their timeline, so if a post catches someone’s attention, it’s very likely that it’s short and doesn’t copy other content.   
### Is the parent company public or private?  
Facebook first went public in 2012 as the shares became available for selling in public markets. Note that Mark Zuckerberg announced on Oct. 28th, 2021, that the name of the parent company (Facebook Inc.) is now Meta Platforms Inc.

## Privacy and Surveillance
### A link to your platform’s ToS and Privacy Policy

### Your key takeaways from your examination of your platform’s ToS and Privacy Policy


## Social Media and your PLN in Education
### Describe how people are able to interact in your platform. Can people leave comments on content? Is there a quick and easy way to ‘Like’ or ‘favourite’ something? Who sees that ‘like?’ Do creators generally respond to comments on their content?  
People are able to interact in my platform either through giving likes or comment or share posts. Some facebook accounts are made public, and these noramlly are business accounts. All people can see "likes", even if they didn't follow the account. If people want to "favourite" something, there's a bottom on the right hand side where you can save the post.  However, research shows that facebook would prioritize posts that are not business content, meaning that facebook is used as a platform that proritize communication on a personal level.     
### How do educators use the platform? What kinds of content are they teaching? Who is their audience? Do they respond to comments or questions? Are they using the platform as a PLN, or are they only creating content?  
For this project, our group followed 10 educators on facebook, and they are all public accounts. Such as @Gerry Brooks, @Teaching in the Fast Lane. They would post their content and than tag another educator,or another eductational organization. In a recent post by Gerry Brooks, he taged a instagram account, which is interesting because when we click on that account, we are directed to the Instagram app. A lot of educators don't reply to the comments, however, they will 'like' some interesting comments. The interaction in the comment section is not very active. But we do see some exceptions for example， @The Tutu Teacher is replying to comments and she has over 6000 followers. But each of her post did not receive many comments, so she is able to respond to most of the comments. In general, I think some educators are using the platform as a PLN, but there's a notice pattern we found: the more followers they have, the more the educators would use this platform to simply share contents, rather than creating a PLN. But, the popular educators would still tag other educators, or repost their content, and comment on them. This may still be considered as interacting with their PLN.   
### Are there any concerns that educators should be aware of regarding your platform (privacy, age-inappropriate content, disinformation, misinformation, offensive or illegal content)?  
They should be aware of the private message scam because as mentioned in previous section, people can directly message others on facebook without following them. Some scam would try to get one's private message by asking "Is this you?"If they reply then they may be giving more private information in order to confirm with that person "this isn't me". Also, for an account that is made public, it is best not to share personal information on that account. Some educators made their account private but they are still able to engage in their PLN. So if the account is not to spread the content to a boarder audience, one should protect one's privacy.  
### Make note of other things you notice that a curious educator might want to know about your platform.  
 This platform allows educator to create a group for the class, if they envite students on facebook group, they could better communicate with their students. Further, facebook also allows online meeting, so if there's an emergent meeting, facebook live is always an option. Facebook also allows teachers to create polls, this could be a very good tool for teachers if they want to adjust the syllubas and ask students if they agree to these changes. Or they can make polls about course evaluations in the middle of semester, in this way, teachers could know if their teaching is working or not working. Teachers could also tag other teachers who teach on the same topic, and maybe share some experience with each other. They could also invite students in the conversation, let them also making connections with a wider educational network.

## Balancing your PLN and Public Discourse  
### How do notable, high-profile individuals use social media?
Notable, high-profile individuals use social media mainly to distribute business content, using the platform share content and contribute to larger conversation with other notable individuals. Unless some comments attract their attention, they are unlikely to respond to the comment section. The higher the social status they own, the less likely they are going to reply to comments. However, they do tag other notable individuals, that may be considered as their PLN.
### What are the benefits to being in the public eye and having a PLN?
Benefits to being in the public eye and having a PLN might include: exchange knowledge, gain more access to resources and build relationship with others.
### Building community with online tools provided by an employer can be limiting, what are some possible restrictions and benefits?
Some possible restrictions and benefits of building community with online tools might be: privacy are more protected. Usually an online tool provided by a company is more safe, because the employers know that the communication involves many business contents that cannot be leaked, so they will choose online tools that could provide them privacy protection. On the other hand, these online tools cannot provide employees an opportunity to connect to wider online users, and this limits their PLN.
### Delivering information in a connected society requires verifiable resources, how can you ensure that you build a PLN you can rely on?
We think we can build a PLN based on the criteria of whether the members in the PLN respect copy rights issue, for example, they know the difference between creative commons and non creative commons. 
### How do those who are veteran story tellers minimize the risk of sharing misinformation?
They would know how to evaluate their resources, for example, see if their resources come from a valid source, such as database, notable publications, journals. They would compare different sites' information on the same topic, and deliver their content after they done enough research about it.

## Digital Identity, Access and Inclusion, and Media Literacy (including Trust and Disinformation)  
### How do you present yourself in social media? Do you have separate identities for personal and work or school use? Do you integrate your personal and professional identities? Do you use different platforms for different purposes?
I (wenzhuo) present myself in social media as a visitor, I am not a resident as far as I consider. I often view sites, or do research rather than distribute content online. I mainly use Twitter for political news, and YouTube to watch professionals playing games. 
### How does the platform you chose for the Major Project incorporate accessibility and inclusion principles. How are disabled people treated on the platform? Are there multiple ways people can consume or produce content to meet accessibility needs? How do you include those who might otherwise be excluded?
The facebook platform we chose for the major project incorporate accessibility and inclusion principles because everyone have access to the platform without discrimination. However, many of the contents on facebook are not filtered and full of personal bias and misinformation. This means, we could have posts that are discrimnative towards minority groups. 
### Media Literacy, Trust, and Disinformation Does your chosen platform have content moderation policies? Does it flag disinformation, or provide links to trusted resources? How do you ensure that you don’t spread disinformation as misinformation? (Hint: this last question might require you to do a bit of legwork to learn about Media Literacy.
